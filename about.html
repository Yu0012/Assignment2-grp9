      <h2>About Our Project</h2>
      <p>Our project centers on the critical role of nursing as a healthcare resource and its impact on healthcare systems. In particular, we explore the availability, distribution, and utilization of nursing resources within healthcare systems, aiming to highlight the current landscape and challenges.</p>
      
      <p>Given the essential nature of nursing in patient care and public health, understanding these dynamics is key to addressing shortages, improving patient outcomes, and supporting healthcare workers' well-being.</p>
      
      <div class="info-container">
        <p>Using OECD Health Statistics, our visualizations offer an in-depth look at data trends related to nursing resources across various countries, including nurse-to-patient ratios, workforce growth, and geographic disparities. By combining clear, accessible visual narratives with robust data, we aim to inform stakeholders and policymakers, supporting evidence-based decision-making to strengthen nursing infrastructure worldwide.</p>
