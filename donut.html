            The dataset provided shows the total number of practicing nurses across various countries (New Zealand, United States, Canada, Denmark, and Japan) over a span of years from 2018 to 2022. This data is essential for understanding healthcare resources over time and reveals trends in nursing capacity within each country. From 2018 to 2022, the United States consistently reports the highest number of practicing nurses, with an upward trend reaching over 4 million by 2022. Canada follows with steady growth, peaking at 427,390 nurses in 2021 before seeing a slight decline in 2022. Japan also shows a consistent rise, reaching 1,621,095 by 2020. In contrast, smaller countries like Denmark and New Zealand exhibit more modest totals but show gradual increases over time. New Zealand's count of nurses, for instance, increases each year, reaching 62,162 by 2022, reflecting a growth in its healthcare workforce.

            A donut chart visualization of this data would provide a clear comparative view of the share of practicing nurses by country in a single year or over the full range. Such a visual could reveal disparities in nurse availability, which may correlate with each country's population size, healthcare funding, and demands on the healthcare system. Analyzing these patterns can inform decisions on resource allocation and workforce planning in response to healthcare needs.
